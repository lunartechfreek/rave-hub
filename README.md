Rave/Hub is a website made for educational purposes for my fourth portfolio project in software development that I am studying with the Code Institute. The website is aimed at users who are looking for upcoming festivals that they might like to attend. 

While designing this website I took into account the real world demands that users and event owners would have for a real events website. To adhere to these demands I have created a dynamic website what creates pages when a new event owner is added and when a new event is added by that owner for example. The website is fully responsive no matter what device it is viewed on. 

I have applied the technologies I have learnt so far and used HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Django to create the website. Other technologies used are listed in the technologies used section further down the page.
